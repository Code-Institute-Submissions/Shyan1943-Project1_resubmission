### 3) STRUCTURE

#### 3a) Information Architecture

<img src="img/IA Sitemap.png" width="441" height="266"/>

#### 3b) Interaction Design

Our website behave more like people. A system has with its users all the time. Make users feel like its a natural conversation with real person. When clicking something, they get back something. 

Just like our fixed-top navigation bar, users can click on it and get what users want immediately, instead of by scrolling-up to the top or still have to click a scroll up button. 

Another example is our contact functions. Users can choose their most comfortable way by simply click on "call us", "email us", "whatsapp us" to get in touch with us immediately. Rather than filing up the particulars, submit and wait for our reply.  
<br>
<br>
### 4) SKELETON

#### 4a) Interface design 

This is a responsive website, which users can view, get the same information & reach us by using difference IT products. Also, In a world where users are constantly bombarded with too much content, people love simplicity. With this, we design it as an "One-page websites" offer a fast and clear reading experience. 

#### 4b) Navigation design 

<img src="img/Contact (Nav sample).png" width="441" height="196"/>

I use the concept "simplify option", so it's very clear where to click on. A "fixed-top" navigation bar is designed for user's convenience from one page to another easily. I also implement the hover function, so users know its clickable when mouse over. By clicking the "call us", "email us" or "whatsapp us" button, it can straight a way bring the user to the call function without typing our number, create a new email without typing our email address and even go direct to the whatsapp chatting page without typing & saving our contact before reaching us. 
 
#### 4c) Information Design
It means that the presentation of information in a way that facilitates understanding. I make use of the carousel slideshow at the landing page by presenting the related pictures, it straight away transmit a message to the site visitor that we are providing shipping & logistics services. In our services page, instead of writing a full paragraph to telling people what we are providing, we use the picture to represent a thousand words. Just mouse over at the services picture without clicking, an animation transition performs to give a short and shape introduction of the services. 
<br>
<br>
### 5) SURFACE

<img src="img/Color.png" width="441" height="266"/>

One of my visual design is to standardize the font to one only "Poppins, serif". Also, trying to keep the color skin in blue & gold to match with the logo color. lastly are the photo choosing, it must be able to transmit business goal message, easy understand and matching our theme color. 
<br>
<br>
### 6) TESTING

#### 6a) Validating Markup : 
All pages validated using W3 Markup Validation Service (http://validator.w3.org/). Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show.

#### 6b) Hyperlink Check : 
All pages checked using W3C Link Checker (https://validator.w3.org/checklink). The result show there are errors with linking to call, fax, email or whatsapp. However, if I tested on the laptop or mobile, which have the call, email or whatsapp function it will run well. 

#### 6c) Navigation Check :
Clicked on each of the navigation on every page and ensure they linked to the right place. 
Clicked on each of the carousel photo navigation and the previous and next page (whenever is active) on every page and ensure they linked to the right place.
